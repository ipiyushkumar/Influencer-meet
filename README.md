# Our Website
## Budget
1. Option 1 - wordpress, i believe there are plugins for the above services but  need to check them out.
2. Option 2 - custom Site. Hosting By AWS or Azure since its based on usage For cost Effectiveness.

If we are going custom site we are going to need the following.
AWS Server
GOOGLE meet APi [Google APi](https://developers.google.com/meet/api/guides/limits)
ZOOM meet API [Zoom Meet API](https://zoom.us/pricing/developer)
APIs for other websites (Instagram, Linkedin, Whatsapp)
An App tracking API
Marketing API to generate sales
Some Kind of Payment Interface - havent decided, last time i used Razorpay Payment Gateway
Everything Else in development is my headache.

I will update if something else comes to mind.
